      <strong>Nobody's</strong> born smart. <strong>We </strong> all start at 0.
      Can't talk, can't walk, certainly can't do algebra. <br />
      Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody's good at anything at
      first. <br />
      There was a time when <em>Einstein</em> couldn't count to 10. <br />
      and <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.
      <br />
      Thankfully, we are born to learn. <br />
      Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall. <br />
      Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling. <br />
      Until one day, you <strong>walk</strong>. <br />
      One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next. <br />
      Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger. <br />
      Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going. <br />
      <strong><em>This. is. learning.</em></strong> <br />
      It's not that you don't get it. <br />
      You just don't get it, yet. Because the most beautiful, complex concepts
      in the whole universe <br />
      are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand. <br />
      Whoever you are, wherever you are. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      You only have to know one thing: <br />
      <strong><em> You can learn anything.</em></strong>
